WikiCrowd wiki engine was designed for collaboration editing (co-editing) of [Russian edition of bestseller book "Wikinomics"](http://wikinomika.ru/) by Don Tapscott.

There are three points in the base of WikiCrowd:
  * Simple text editing.
  * The same page editing by many people at the same time.
  * Extensibility with plugins.

**WikiCrowd is the best for collaboration book writing and translating.**
